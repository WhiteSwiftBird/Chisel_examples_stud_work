To run the tests for solutions generated from Chisel, 
you need to include the absolute path to the synthesized 
files [Name].v in the solution files located in the task 
directories of the synthesis school. Add the following line 
to the solution files or edit it:

`include "[path]"

Replace [path] with your own absolute path to the synthesized 
Verilog files ([Name].v). This ensures that the necessary 
modules are correctly referenced during simulation or synthesis.
